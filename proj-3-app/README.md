Wilson's Wows

Like Keanu Reeves (Whoa) & Matthew McConaughey (alright) before him,
Owen Wilson is a man synonymous with one word: "Wow."

Ever since the first "Wow" in his feature film debut in 1996's Bottlerocket, Hollywood's favorite troublemaker has gone on to say the word in 27 different movies for a total of 81 times. Midnight in Paris holds the record for a whopping seven times.

Wilson's Wows generates a random Owen Wilson "Wow" from one of his movies.

The original "Wow" from Bottle Rocket is memorialized as well.

Over time, ideally a broader collection of "Wows" will be displayed beneath the generator (just ran out of time on this one :).
